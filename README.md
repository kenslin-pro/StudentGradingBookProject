# Overview

As a software engineer, my goal in creating this Java program was to enhance my understanding of the Java language and its syntax. The Student Gradebook program demonstrates my proficiency in Java and showcases my ability to design and implement a simple yet functional application.

The purpose of this software is to provide a basic solution for managing student grades. It allows users to add, update, and calculate grades for individual students. The program serves as a practical example of handling data structures, user input, and basic calculations in Java.
